use:
1/goto: http://localhost/useraccounts/ -> generate admin user. -> then login as admin -> then added tags for default display.(the tags generated by default should be removed, if met exception when deleting the tags, just ignore it.)
2/generate a user administrator. -> then login as administrator -> then create a "unclassified tag with this administrator. (it will be the default one when creating content). remove all other tags generated by default.
3/generate a user of Tao, because admin told every one to leave message to Tao if met problem.
4/generate a user of robots, this account is created just to avoid the robots try from openshift cause unnecessary exceptions and logs.

dev:
1/get the source code, unzip it, then import it as eclipse project.
2/the code is using hsql db under the folder where eclipse.exe is.
3/run rds.bat to get the en,cn,fr versions ready for being published onto server using postgresQL DB. the all-thebest version (for test) is ready on dropbox folder and so do the code bk .
  the tomcate is left as using postgresQL DB and it stands in dropbox too. (Strongly suggested don't do publish until the test has passed on all-thebest.rhcloud.com)
4/open the dropbox now, let the tomcat/webapp/bigbang and the Root.war for all-thebest uploaded.
5/on Acer machine, open dropbox to get the latest version of tomcat/webapp/bigbang and the Root.war.run git commit and git push for all-thebest.
6/on Acer machine, add selenium test script with locale bibang, and test it with the all-thebest.rhcloud.com website.
7/if the script passed on all-thebest website. run gitpush command for cn, en, and fr version.
8/if modified anything in index.jspx, modify the three index_xx.jspx file under deploy folder.

DB
1/locale client use HSQL as DB.
2/Server side use PostgresQL as DB. 
3/when table of PostgresQL DB is first generated, DO REMEMBER to change the Message,Remark,Twitter tables to change type of content column from string(255) to text

test:
1/when run the selenium, set the speed, make it not the fastest, I use 2/3 speed .
2/make sure tao:1234 admin:2ert are available, and tao has tag of "Simon&Nicholas"
3/selenium can not record selection action in drop box, so have to manuly add some date for test:
	1)authoritized contens: guy is lady's team -> guy has two tag, one private, one for team. in team tag, there's 2 content, one is private, one is for team.
	2)can see nothing if not login as lady nor guy.
	3)login as guy, can see everything in guy space, and because guy is lady's team, so in other space can see all contents which of 0 and 2
		while, if some content is 2, but the othor is not lady but some one else
4/set the firefox default display language as simple Chinese.

know bugs:
1/works better with the tomcat6 on rhcloud, when work with the tomcat7 on rhcloud, the select component will not pop up the options (when with my local tomcat7.0.27 everything's fine, so NOW I AM THINKING ABOUT IT MIGHT BE IE64/IE32 PROBLEM).
